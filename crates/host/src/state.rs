//! Per-store host state shared across every chain stage.
//!
//! One [`Store<HostState>`] per session. Every stage in the chain
//! instantiates into that single store; they share one
//! [`ResourceTable`], one [`WasiCtx`], one outbound bridge channel.
//! This is the prerequisite for shared resources across stages and
//! removes the per-stage actor/mpsc dispatch.
//!
//! Each stage's identity is its index into [`HostState::stages`].
//! Bindgen's `add_to_linker` takes a `fn` pointer host getter — it
//! cannot capture — so we route per-stage context through a stack:
//! [`HostState::stage_stack`] is pushed before invoking a stage's
//! `bindings.yosh_acp_*().call_*(accessor, ...)` and popped after.
//! Host imports read the top of the stack to know which stage is
//! currently executing.
