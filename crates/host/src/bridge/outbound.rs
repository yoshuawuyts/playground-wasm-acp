//! Drains wasm-emitted [`OutboundEvent`]s and forwards them to the editor
//! over the ACP connection.
//!
//! Notifications go out inline. Outbound requests issue immediately via
//! `cx.send_request` and the `block_task().await` is handed to `cx.spawn`
//! so the drain loop returns to `outbound_rx.recv()` right away.
//!
//! Awaiting `block_task` inline would deadlock: it's documented as unsafe
//! to await from anything that's blocking the connection's event loop
//! (handlers, the `connect_with` body). The editor reply lands at the
//! transport actor in milliseconds but the inline await never wakes —
//! only the wasm guest's outer timeout tears the chain down. Running
//! `block_task` inside a `cx.spawn`-ed task is the supported pattern.
