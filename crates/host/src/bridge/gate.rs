//! Notification gate for held-back `session/update` events.
//!
//! `available_commands_update` (and other notifications) emitted by a
//! layer **during** `session/new` arrive at the editor before the
//! `session/new` response, so the editor doesn't yet know the session
//! id and silently drops them. The gate buffers updates per session
//! until the bridge handler calls [`open_session`] after responding.
//!
//! Once a session is opened, future notifications bypass the gate and
//! are forwarded immediately.
